# SymbolBalance_Project
The Symbol Balance Checker is a program that verifies whether symbols like parentheses (), curly brackets {}, and square brackets [] are properly balanced in an input string. It uses a stack-based algorithm to detect missing or misplaced brackets and provides instant feedback on whether the input is balanced.
